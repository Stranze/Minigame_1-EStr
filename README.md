You start in a scene with an start and a quit button, and with an Image explaining how to play.
If you decide to play the game you are now in a scene in which all you can do is dodging these solid blocks of concrete for about 50 seconds, if you manage to do so whithout getting hit, you will find yourself in the Happy End Screen, if you get hit, multiple times, you will find yourself at the Bad End Screen.
